### **Intuition** 
--- 
we compare the each element and return the min and max element while traversing

### **Approach**
---
This is a very basic but important problem.  
We need to find the `maximum` and `minimum` element from a given array by checking every element exactly once.

Let's consider an example:

```
Input: arr = [3, 1, 8, 2, 7]
```

The output should be:

```
[1, 8]
 ↑  ↑
min max
```

### **Why this works?**

---

We maintain two variables:

- `max` → store the largest value seen so far
- `min` → store the smallest value seen so far

Initially:

```
max = -Infinity
min = Infinity
```

Then we iterate through the array and update them when needed.

### **Step-by-step Dry Run**

---

Let's go through each element:  
In first iteration, element `3` is greater than `-Infinity`? _Yes_, so we assign it to `max`  
same as `3` is less than `Infinity`? _Yes_, so we assign it to `min`

```
arr = [3, 1, 8, 2, 7]
       ↑
       i = 0

max = -∞ → 3
min =  ∞ → 3
```

In second iteration, element `1` is greater than `3` ? _No_, so we did not need to change the `max`  
now `1` is less than `3`? _Yes_, so we assign it to `min`

```
arr = [3, 1, 8, 2, 7]
          ↑
          i = 1

max = 3
min = 3 → 1
```

In third iteration, element `8` is greater than `3` ? _Yes_, so we assign it to `max`  
now `8` is less than `1`? _No_, so we did not need to change the `min`

```
arr = [3, 1, 8, 2, 7]
             ↑
             i = 2

max = 3 → 8
min = 1
```

In fourth iteration, element `2` is greater than `8` ? _No_, so we did not need to change the `max`  
similarly `2` is not less than `1` so we did not need to change the `min`

```
arr = [3, 1, 8, 2, 7]
                ↑
                i = 3

max = 8
min = 1
```

In fifth iteration, element `7` is greater than `8` ? _No_, so we did not need to change the `max`  
similarly `7` is not less than `1` so we did not need to change the `min`

```
arr = [3, 1, 8, 2, 7]
                   ↑
                   i = 4

max = 8
min = 1
```

so we return the answer:

```
return {max : 8, min : 1}
```
### **Complexity**
---
- Time complexity:  
We iterate through the array only once. So the time complexity is *O(n)*  

- Space Complexity:  
No extra space is used except variables `max` and `min`. So the space complexity is *O(1)*

### **JavaScript Code**  

``````javascript []
function getMinMax(arr) {

  let max = -Infinity;
  let min = Infinity;

  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if(arr[i] > max) max = arr[i]
    if(arr[i] < min) min = arr[i]
  }

  return { max, min };
}
