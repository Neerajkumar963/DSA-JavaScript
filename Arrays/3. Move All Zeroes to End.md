### **Intuition**

---

we can solve this problem using two approaches:

- In first approach we create an empty `ans` array and then we traverse on input array and copy the non-zero element and rest with zero.
- In second approach we will use two pointer approach.

### **Approach 1**

---

Using extra array:

Let's take an example:

```
Input : arr = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12]
```

the output should be :

```
[1, 3, 12, 0, 0]
```

### **Why this works?**

---

We initialize an empty array `ans` that will store the result.

Initially:

```
ans = []
```

Now we traverse on the input array and update `ans` array if we get non zero element

### **Step-by-step Dry Run**

---
```
Iteration 1

[0, 1, 0, 3, 12]     
 ↑
 i = 0

arr[i] = 0 → don't copy    ans = []

```
```
Iteration 2

[0, 1, 0, 3, 12]     
    ↑
    i = 1

arr[i] = 1 → copy →  ans = [1]

```
```
Iteration 3

[0, 1, 0, 3, 12]     
       ↑
       i = 2

arr[i] = 0 → don't copy     ans = [1]

```
```
Iteration 4

[0, 1, 0, 3, 12]     
          ↑
          i = 3

arr[i] = 3 → copy →  ans = [1, 3]

```
```
Iteration 5

[0, 1, 0, 3, 12]     
              ↑
              i = 4

arr[i] = 12 → copy →  ans = [1, 3, 12]

```
now we push 0 in our `ans` array so it's length become equal to original array
```
ans = [1, 3, 12, 0, 0]
```
and in the end we return `ans`
### **Complexity**

---

- Time complexity:  
  we are traversing on the whole array so the time complexity is _O(n)_
- Space Complexity:  
  we are using extra space `ans` so the space complexity is _O(n)_

### **JavaScript Code**

```js
function moveZeroes(arr) {
  let ans = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] !== 0) {
      ans.push(arr[i]);
    }
  }

  while (arr.length > ans.length) {
    ans.push(0);
  }
  return ans;
}
```

### **Approach 2**

---

Two-pointer (In-place)

let's take the same example :

```
Input : arr = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12]
```

the output should be :

```
[1, 3, 12, 0, 0]
```

### **Why this works?**

---
we maintain `j` variable that mark the position where the non-zero element go

Initially :

```
j = 0
```
Now if we got any non-zero element we swap it with `arr[j]` and then we increment our `j` variable by one


### **Step-by-step Dry Run**

---

Let's go through each step :

```
Iteration 1

 j = 0
 ↓
[0, 1, 0, 3, 12]     
 ↑
 i = 0

arr[i] = 0 → do nothing

```
```
Iteration 2

 j = 0                           j = 0                            j = 1
 ↓                               ↓                                ↓
[0, 1, 0, 3, 12]      →         [1, 0, 0, 3, 12]        →     [1, 0, 0, 3, 12] 
    ↑               swap        ↑                      j++          ↑
    i = 1                       i = 1                               i = 1

arr[i] = 1 → swap and j++

```
```
Iteration 3

    j = 1               
    ↓                      
[1, 0, 0, 3, 12]      
       ↑              
       i = 2                  

arr[i] = 0 → do nothing

```
```
Iteration 4

    j = 1                              j = 1                              j = 2
    ↓                                  ↓                                  ↓       
[1, 0, 0, 3, 12]        →          [1, 3, 0, 0, 12]       →        [1, 3, 0, 0, 12] 
          ↑           swap                   ↑           j++                 ↑
          i = 3                              i = 3                           i = 3

arr[i] = 3 → swap and j++

```
```
Iteration 5

       j = 2                                 j = 2                                  j = 3
       ↓                                     ↓                                      ↓
[1, 3, 0, 0, 12]          →          [1, 3, 12, 0, 0]         →          [1, 3, 12, 0, 0] 
              ↑         swap                       ↑         j++                       ↑
              i = 4                                i = 4                               i = 4

arr[i] = 12 → swap and j++

```
Loop ends.

Final output:
```
[1, 3, 12, 0, 0]
```
### **Complexity**

---

- Time complexity:
  we are traversing on input array at once so the time complexity is _O(n)_
- Space Complexity:
  we are not using any extra space so space complexity is _O(1)_

### **JavaScript Code**

```js
function moveZeroes(arr) {
  let j = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] !== 0) {
      [arr[i], arr[j]] = [arr[j], arr[i]];
      j++;
    }
  }

  return arr; 
}
```
